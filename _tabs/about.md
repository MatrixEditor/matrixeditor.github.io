Welcome to my corner of the internet — a space created from outside the matrix with a focus on security research. Currently, I am exploring the following topics:

- Mobile App testing
- Hardware Hacking
- Active Directory Pentesting/Security
- Reverse Engineering (I know, a bit broad)
- IoT & OT Security
- and many more side topics...

This blog serves as both a personal knowledge archive and a technical journal, where I document experiments and share insights gained through my research. You’ll also find occasional writeups covering niche topics, proof-of-concepts, and detailed breakdowns of unusual findings encountered along the way. Usually, all code I use for these posts is shared on my GitHub profile: [MatrixEditor](https://github.com/MatrixEditor)

> This site’s theme a modified version of [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) with all trackers, analytics, and unnecessary third-party scripts removed. Only scripts that are necessary for visual elements are included.
