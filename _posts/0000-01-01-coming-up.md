- [DIY Firmware Extraction](/posts/adesto-spi-flash/) using a barebone RespberryPi
- AD: The guts of [*Dementor*](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/dementor): basic/advanced techniques and its inner core
- ICS/OT: Basic introduction to [*icspacket*](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/icspacket) and its underlying ASN.1 to Python compiler [*asn1c-bindings*](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/asn1c-bindings).
- Mobile: Short introduction to my previous research on Google's [*pairip-vm*](https://matrixeditor.github.io/pairipcore-vm/)
- Mobile: About a hidden executable within Google's *Play Services Ads* library.
- IoT/Hardware: Meross smartplug firmware reversing and [*amebaz2*](https://github.com/MatrixEditor/amebaz2) chip research

These are just the tip of the iceberg, there is so much more to come. Stay tuned for updates, as I aim to continuously expand on these topics.
